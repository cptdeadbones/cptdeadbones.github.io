Oh my it has been a while. Time flies I tell you. I honestly do not remember the last time I sat down to write, or blog for that matter. But guess what? I am free now! That’s right, I am back and I have a good feeling I am here to stay. 

So where did I go? Wouldn’t you want to know?! All I will say is that my site got attacked by some male ware and I decided it wasn’t worth my time to figure out what exactly went wrong. So instead, I let it die. The months and years have gone by and I decided to let things be. At least for the time being.. 

What has changed? Everything has changed. Well, most things have changed. The one thing that hasn’t changed is my curiosity and love for programming. Other things might have changed, but not that. So without too much drama, let’s say I will try my best to keep this _journal_ updated. I will also try to see if I can dig up some of my old posts. 

Until the next time,
